# A Wordpress WooCommerce Custom Shipping Plugin Starting Point

_Status: Under Development USE AT YOUR OWN RISK_

for:

* Min and Max weight Zone based shipping
* Wordpress Version 5.3.2
* WooCommerce Version 3.9.1

I have created this public repo as I could not find any uptodate information on how to create a 'Custom Wordpress Plugin' for 'WooCommerce Shipping API'. I have found many old (3+ Year) old tutorials that show how to create a custom plugins but many no longer function or do not implement shipping zone features.

I have made this public so other developers can use it as an example for thier clients who require specific shipping requirements based on weights.
