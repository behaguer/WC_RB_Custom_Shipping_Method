# A Wordpress WooCommerce Custom Shipping Plugin Starting Point

_Status: Under Development USE AT YOUR OWN RISK_

for:

* Wordpress Version 5.3.2
* WooCommerce Version 3.9.1

### A plague on all of your houses

I have created this public repo as I could not find any up to date information on how to create a Custom Wordpress Plugin for WooCommerce Shipping. I have found many old (3+ Year) old tutorials that show how to create a Custom Plugin but many no longer function or do not implement shipping zone features.

I have made this public so other developers can use it as a boilerplate for thier clients who require specific shipping requirements.
